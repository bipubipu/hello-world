# hello-world
Hi all,
I'm Cathy! This is my first docu on github. The reason why I use github is that it's a trend and I'm learning to code now!

I never thought of staying up late to fix a bug like now after having spent 6 hours in a small project. My learning coding journey doesn't begin well as I had to study C in school. There're so many and so weird rules that I didn't score high in the first test. Then I remembered the following year to prepare for a certificate in C, I practiced a lot and achieved good grades in the end. This experience taught me a lesson that programming skill can be improved by practising. I know that I am a fast learner but I am not good at sticking in one thing. My daily job has nothing to do with coding but I love the feeling of programs running smoothly and produce your expected results. Thus I come back and take the Python course. It is truly easier to understand and to write. I'm trying to make this a long-term project, everyday a little bit just not to lose the skill.
